# UDACITY Project

In this project I will explain how I completed all the different projects for the SELF DRVING CAR ENGINEERING nanodegree. 

## COMPUTER VISION
This part focus on the camera sensor and how to process raw digital images before feedigh them into different algorithms, such as neural networks. We will build convolutional neural networks using AWS TensorFlow and learn how to classify and detect objects in images. We will learn Machine learning workflow and their basics. 

AWS services are costly and complicated to use, for that reason I've started using OPENVC framework to detect cars and then PYTORCH to learn how to create models from data. Finally, I've used a tensorflow model to identify objects in images.
