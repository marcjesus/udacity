Project Instructions Step 3
Make sure to refer to the project rubric to ensure all tasks are completed.

What is this task about?
In Step 3 of the final project, you will implement a single nearest neighbor data association to associate measurements to tracks. You will finally move on to multi target tracking now!

Task preparation
In addition to the settings from Step 2, apply the following settings in loop_over_dataset.py:

Select Sequence 1 (training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord) by uncommenting this line in loop_over_dataset.py and commenting out the other sequences. This is a more complex scenario with multiple targets.
Set show_only_frames = [0, 200] in order to use the whole sequence now.
Set configs_det.lim_y = [-25, 25] to use the whole y-range including several targets.
Where to find this task?
This task involves writing code within the file student/association.py. Please ignore TODOs for other steps in other files for now.

Your task
In the Association class, implement the associate() function to complete the following tasks:
Replace association_matrix with the actual association matrix based on Mahalanobis distances for all tracks in the input track_list and all measurements in the input meas_list. Use the MHD()function to implement the Mahalanobis distance between a track and a measurement. Also, use the gating() function to check if a measurement lies inside a track's gate. If not, the function shall return False and the entry in association_matrix shall be set to infinity.
Update the list of unassigned measurements unassigned_meas and unassigned tracks unassigned_tracks to include the indices of all measurements and tracks that did not get associated.
In the Association class, implement the get_closest_track_and_meas() function to complete the following tasks:
Find the minimum entry in association_matrix, delete corresponding row and column from the matrix.
Remove corresponding track and measurement from unassigned_tracks and unassigned_meas.
Return this association pair between track and measurement. If no more association was found, i.e. the minimum matrix entry is infinity, return numpy.nan for the track and measurement.
What should the result be?
The association works properly if you see in the visualization that multiple tracks are updated with multiple measurements. The console output shows that each measurement is used at most once and each track is updated at most once. The visualization should show that there are no confirmed “ghost tracks” that do not exist in reality. There may be initialized or tentative “ghost tracks” as long as they are deleted after several frames. Make sure to successfully complete this step and save the RMSE plot before moving to the next. If you still saw some initialized or tentative ghost tracks here, let's see if we can deplausibilize them through sensor fusion with camera in the next step!

Hints
If the console output shows that a single measurement has been used several times, there is an error in the association matrix or in the deletion of used rows and columns. Printing the association matrix for debugging might help.
From misc/params.py, you should load the parameter gating_threshold.
