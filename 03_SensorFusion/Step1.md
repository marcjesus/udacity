Project Instructions Step 1
Make sure to refer to the project rubric to ensure all tasks are completed.

What is this task about?
In Step 1 of the final project, you will implement an EKF to track a single real-world target with lidar measurement input over time!

Task preparation
I have prepared a simple single-target-scenario to get you started. Make sure to carefully follow these steps, because you don't have a running track management or data association yet, so you can't run other multi-target-scenarios - but we'll get to it!

First of all, you need to apply the same model settings for the Resnet neural network as in the mid-term project. Therefore, simply copy your mid-term solution code in student/objdet_detect.py from the mid-term project workspace into the final project workspace. In particular, you need the model configuration settings you used in the mid-term student exercises ID_S3_EX1-3 and ID_S3_EX1-4.

To select the right single-target-scenario, apply the following settings in loop_over_dataset.py:

Select Sequence 2 (training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord) by uncommenting this line in loop_over_dataset.py and commenting the other sequences.
Set show_only_frames = [150, 200] in order to limit the sequence to frames 150 to 200. This is the time span where our single object is visible.
Set configs_det = det.load_configs(model_name='fpn_resnet') to use the Resnet neural network architecture. Note that Darknet is not applicable here because it does not estimate the height.
Set configs_det.lim_y = [-5, 10] to limit the y-range and remove other targets left and right of our target. To do so, uncomment the respective line.
Set exec_detection = [] to skip the lidar detection for faster execution and to load the lidar results from file instead.
Set exec_tracking = ['perform_tracking'] to activate tracking.
Set exec_visualization = ['show_tracks'] for track visualization.
Where to find this task?
This task involves writing code within the file student/filter.py. Please ignore TODOs for other steps in other files for now.

Your task
The single track is already initialized for you, so don't worry about track initialization right now.
In student/filter.py, implement the predict() function for an EKF. Implement the F() and Q() functions to calculate a system matrix for constant velocity process model in 3D and the corresponding process noise covariance depending on the current timestep dt. Note that in our case, dt is fixed and you should load it from misc/params.py. However, in general, the timestep might vary. At the end of the prediction step, save the resulting x and P by calling the functions set_x() and set_P() that are already implemented in student/trackmanagement.py.
Implement the update() function as well as the gamma() and S() functions for residual and residual covariance. You should call the functions get_hx and get_H that are already implemented in students/measurements.py to get the measurement function evaluated at the current state, h(x), and the Jacobian H. Note that we have a linear measurement model for lidar, so h(x)=H*x for now. You should use h(x) nevertheless for the residual to have an EKF ready for the nonlinear camera measurement model you'll need in Step 4. Again, at the end of the update step, save the resulting x and P by calling the functions set_x() and set_P() that are already implemented in student/trackmanagement.py.
Use numpy.matrix() for all matrices as learned in the exercises.
What should the result be?
If you have implemented everything correctly, the RMSE plot should show a mean RMSE of 0.35 or smaller. You can see the computed mean RMSE in the legend on the right. Make sure to successfully complete this step and save the RMSE plot before moving to the next.

Hints
We now want to track 3D objects with a constant velocity model including height estimation, so F and Q will be 6D matrices, in comparison to our 2D tracking in the lesson exercise where we assumed a flat world. Therefore, you need to implement the following matrices: [TODO: include image of Latex formulas]
Remember from the repository overview on the last page that there is a Track class and a Measurement class. These classes define your input to the predict() and update() functions. So you can get the track data by calling track.x and track.P, the measurement data by calling meas.z and meas.R. Also note that the measurement has an attribute sensor that tells us which sensor generated this measurement, so you can get the measurement matrix by calling meas.sensor.get_H(). Take a closer look at the two classes for clarification.
Note that you don't have a running track management yet, therefore the track state is fixed at 'confirmed' and the score remains at the initial value zero.
From misc/params.py, you should load the following parameters: dt, q, dim_state.
